# Week 1: Practice with Classmates

## 1. Video material
Watch the videos in the readme file and make notes for yourself. We expect you to integrate some of the best practices from the examples provided.

## 2. Discuss best practices
Find a video together on the internet that both of you agree shows a very good presentation. Write down 3 things that you think the presenter is doing well and discuss this. Also write down one thing you would like to improve yourself, based on what you have seen.

## 3. Practice!
It is time to practice. You will prepare a presentation and receive feedback. 

## A. Prepare a 5-10 minute presentation
Please prepare a presentation of a maximum of 10 minutes. The subject does not matter, it can be about anything you are a big fan of (pizza, JS functions, Shakespeare, Tjebbe Schalij, quantum physics). Don’t spend too much time thinking about the perfect subject. This exercise is about the delivery, not the exact content.

Please do not use slides. The focus of your presentation should be on you and your delivery.

## B. Practice yourself
Now rehearse your presentation a few times. You can do this in front of the mirror, in the shower, to a friend, whatever. THe more you practice the better it will be. Try to think of some of the basic principles of a good presentation.

## C. Record Video
Now it’s time to record your presentation. Afterwards share the recording in the class channel on Slack.

## D. Receive and give feedback
After you finish your presentation it is important to give feedback. Please provide feedback to your classmate based on the following:

- Main positive
- Main challenge
- Body language (good posture, eye contact, nerves gestures, smile), 
- Speak slowly and use pauses, 
- Good use of voice (clear and loud enough), 
- Engagement of audience

For each point make sure your feedback is as specific as possible. Give examples to illustrate your feedback.

You will receive feedback from your colleague as well :) Please write down the feedback in an orderly fashion in reply to the video of your colleague in Slack.
