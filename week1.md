# Week 1: Practice with Buddy 

## 1. Video material
Watch the videos no. 1 - 3 below and make notes for yourself. We expect you to integrate some of the best practices from the examples provided.

## 2. Discuss best practices
Find a video on the internet that both of you agree to be a very good presentation. Write down two positives that you think the presenter is doing well in the Excel-sheet and discuss this. Also discuss one key takeaway you would like to improve on when presenting in the next few weeks, based on what you have learned from the video. 

## 3. Practice!
It is time to practice. You will prepare a presentation and deliver it to your classmate. 

## A. Prepare a 5-10 minute presentation
Please prepare a presentation of a maximum of 10 minutes. The subject does not matter, it can be about anything you are a big fan of (pizza, JS functions, Shakespeare, Tjebbe Schalij, quantum physics). Don’t spend too much time thinking about the perfect subject. This exercise is about the delivery, not the exact content. If you want, you can use slides to support your presentation, but it is not necessary. If you do use slides, please use a maximum of one slide per minute without too much information on them.

## B. Practice yourself
Now rehearse your presentation a few times. You can do this in front of the mirror, in the shower, to a friend, whatever. The more you practice the better it will be. Try to think of some of the basic principles of a good presentation (see video 1 below).

## C. Present it to your classmate
Now it’s time to present to each other. Please make sure to make a recording while you present and share the recording with the HYF staff.

## D. Receive and give feedback
After you finish your presentation it is important to give and receive feedback. We want you to evaluate your classmate based on the following:


body language (good posture, eye contact, nerves gestures, smile), 
speak clearly, loud enough and use pauses, 
engagement of audience (do you get energy out of the presentation)


Also write down one thing that he/she did very well. You will receive feedback from your colleague as well :)
