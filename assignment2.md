# Presentation Assignment II: Presentation for HYF staff

Start this week by reviewing the feedback you received last week from your classmate and re-watch your presentation. What went well and what could improve? 

This is important as this week's assignment, for which you will give a presentation to the HYF team. We will schedule a time slot with you. Note: this is a live-presentation in a video call, not a recorded video.

The assignment is similar to the one of last week: we want you to prepare a 5-10 minutes presentation. Again, don’t spend too much time thinking about the perfect subject; and you may reuse the same topic as for the previous assignment if you wish. This exercise is about the delivery, not the exact content. Please do not use slides and DO NOT read from your notes. 

We will evaluate your performance based on the following indicators:
- Content delivered in a structured manner
- Body language (good posture, eye contact, nervous gestures, smile)
- Speak slowly and use pauses
- Good use of voice (clear, loud enough and variety in tone)
- Engagement of audience
- English proficiency

Tip: If you want to practice in the week leading up to the presentation, you can make use of your classmates. The HYF staff is also available for tips!
