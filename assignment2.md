# Presentation Assignment II: Presentation for HYF staff

Start this week by reviewing the feedback you have received from your classmate last week, and re-watch your presentation. What went well and what could still improve?

Please, use your peer's feedback as well as your own reflection on your presentation to improve your presentation. This week, you will have to present it again, but this time to the HYF team and peers. We will schedule a time slot with you. Note: this is a live presentation in a video call, not a recorded video.

The assignment is similar to the one of last week: we would like you to prepare a 5-10 minutes presentation. Again, donâ€™t spend too much time thinking about the perfect topic; you may even reuse the one from the previous assignment if you wish. This exercise is about the delivery, not the exact content. Please do not use slides and DO NOT read from your notes. 

We will evaluate your performance based on the following indicators:
- content delivered in a structured manner
- clear goal and message
- body language (good posture, eye contact, nervous gestures, smile)
- speaking pace and use of pauses
- good use of voice (clear, loud enough and variety in tone)
- engagement of the audience
- English proficiency

Please refer to the previous assignment for more tips on how to deliver a good presentation.

Tip: If you would like to practice in the week leading up to the presentation, you can make use of your peers. The HYF staff is also available for tips!
