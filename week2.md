# Week 2: Presentation for HYF staff

Start this week by reviewing the feedback you received last week from your class-mate and re-watch your presentation. What went well and what could improve? This is important as at the end of this week you will give a presentation to the HYF team.

For this week we want you to prepare a 5-10 minute presentation. Please submit the URL before the deadline through the Excel-sheet.

Again, donâ€™t spend too much time thinking about the perfect subject. This exercise is about the delivery, not the exact content. Slides are an option, but not necessary. 

The big difference is that the HYF staff will assess your performance, after you have submitted the video.

We will evaluate your performance based on the same indicators:
- body language (good posture, eye contact, nerves gestures, smile), 
- speak clearly, loud enough and use pauses, 
- engagement of audience (do you get energy out of the presentation)
- English language skills (!)


Tip: If you want to practice in the days leading up to the presentation, you can make use of your colleague. The HYF staff is also available for tips and practice!
