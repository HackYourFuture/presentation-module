# Week 2: Presentation for HYF staff

Start this week by reviewing the feedback you received last week from your class-mate and re-watch your presentation. What went well and what could improve? 

This is important as this week you will give a presentation to the HYF team. The HYF-team will schedule a time slot with you.

The assignment is similar to the one of last week. We want you to prepare a 5-10 minute presentation. Again, donâ€™t spend too much time thinking about the perfect subject. This exercise is about the delivery, not the exact content. Please do not use slides. 

We will evaluate your performance based on the following indicators:
- Content delivered in a structured manner
- Body language (good posture, eye contact, nerves gestures, smile)
- Speak slowly and use pauses
- Good use of voice (clear, loud enough and variety in tone,
- Engagement of Audience
- English Proficiency

Tip: If you want to practice in the week leading up to the presentation, you can make use of your classmate. The HYF staff is also available for tips!
