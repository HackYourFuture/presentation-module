# Presentation Assignment I: Practice with classmates

## 1. Video material
Watch the videos in the readme file and make notes for yourself. We expect you to integrate some of the best practices from the examples provided.

## 2. Discuss best practices
Find a video together on the internet that both of you agree shows a very good presentation. Write down 3 things you think the presenter is doing well and discuss them. Also write down one thing you would like to improve yourself, based on what you have seen.

## 3. Practice!
It is time to practice. You will prepare a presentation and receive feedback. 

## A. Prepare a 5-10 minute presentation
Please prepare a presentation of a maximum of 10 minutes. The subject does not matter, it can be about anything you are a big fan of (pizza, JS functions, Shakespeare, Rob van Kruijsdijk, quantum physics). Don’t spend too much time thinking about the perfect topic. This exercise is about the delivery, not the exact content.

Please do not use slides. The focus of your presentation should be on you and your delivery.

A presentation is slightly different from a tutorial: it is not about explaining how to execute something, but about topic about a certain topic.

## B. Practice yourself
Now rehearse your presentation a few times. You can do this in front of the mirror, in the shower, to a friend, whatever. THe more you practice, the better it will be. Try to think of some of the basic principles of a good presentation.

## C. Record a video
Now it’s time to record your presentation. Afterwards, share the recording in the Slack class channel.

## D. Receive and give feedback
After you finish your presentation, it is important to give feedback. Please provide feedback to your classmate, based on the following:

- Main positive point
- Main challenge
- Body language (posture, eye contact, nerves gestures, smile)
- Speaking pace and use of pauses
- Use of voice (clearity and loudness)
- Auduience engagement

For each point, make sure your feedback is as specific as possible. Give examples to illustrate your feedback.

You will receive feedback from your colleague as well :) Please write down the feedback in an orderly fashion in reply to the video of your colleague in Slack.
