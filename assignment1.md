# Presentation Assignment I: Practice with a peer

## 1. Video material
Watch the videos in the readme file and make notes for yourself. We expect you to integrate some of the best practices from the examples provided.

## 2. Discuss best practices
Together with your peer, find a video on the internet for which both of you agree that it offers a good presentation. Write down 3 things you think the presenter is doing well and discuss them. Also write down one thing you would like to improve yourself, based on what you have seen.

## 3. Practice!
It is time to practice. You will prepare a presentation and receive feedback. 

## A. Prepare a 5-10 minute presentation
Please prepare a presentation of a maximum of 10 minutes. The subject does not matter, it can be about anything you are a big fan of (History, Shakespeare, Rob van Kruijsdijk, quantum physics). The only topic you cannot pick is Javascript ;) You will have plenty of time to discuss coding during technical assignments, so let's focus on other topics for now... No need to spend too much time thinking about the perfect topic: this exercise is about the delivery, not the exact content.

Please do not use slides, as the focus of your presentation should be on you and your delivery.

A presentation is slightly different from a tutorial: it is not about explaining how to execute something, but about conveing a message, convincing an audience or teaching something.

## B. Practice yourself
Now rehearse your presentation a few times. You can do this in front of the mirror, in the shower, to a friend or a peer, whatever works for you. The more you practice, the better you will get. Try to think of some of the basic principles of a good presentation.

## C. Record a video
Itâ€™s time to record your presentation. Once you're done, share the recording in the Slack cohort channel.

## D. Receive and give feedback
After you finish your presentation, it is important to give feedback. Please provide orderly feedback to the colleague you were paired with, based on the followings:

- main positive point
- main challenge
- body language (posture, eye contact, nerves gestures, smile)
- speaking pace and use of pauses
- use of voice (clearity and loudness)
- audience engagement

For each point, make sure your feedback is as specific as possible. Give examples to illustrate your points.
You may submit your feedback in comments to the video of your colleague, in Slack.

You will receive feedback from your colleague as well :)
